# Elements-Arise
Design of the Alpha stage of an RPG videogame using Unity.

Elements Arise was designed and developed entirely by my classmate Alejandro and myself. This RPG (Role Playing Game) is based on a fictionary world in the Medieval Age.
The development was done in Unity. The scripts were programmed in C#.
